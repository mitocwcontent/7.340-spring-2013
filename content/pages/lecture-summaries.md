| {{< td-colspan 3 >}}**{{< anchor "T1" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Topic 1: Fixer Uppers: Parasite-mediated Remodeling of the Host Cell and its Disease Implications:** During infection, intracellular microorganisms tailor host cell pathways to their own needs, enabling them to control cell responses, avoid host defenses and establish a niche in which to grow. The themes covered in this topic will include mechanisms of parasite protein export, subversion of host signaling cascades, remodeling of the host actin cytoskeleton by the parasite and manipulation of the host environment at large.{{< /td-colspan >}} |||

This paper includes methods of identification and characterization of new virulence factors and how to use microarray technology to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously as a way to examine the effects of parasite gene expression on the host cell._ {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Ong, Y. C., M. L. Reese, et al. "[_Toxoplasma_ Rhoptry Protein 16 (ROP16) Subverts Host Function by Direct Tyrosine Phosphorylation of STAT6](http://dx.doi.org//10.1074/jbc.M110.112359)." _The Journal of Biological Chemistry_ 285, no. 37 (2010): 28731–40. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _This work exemplifies the generation of parasite knockout strains to define the molecular function of specific genes. We will discuss approaches to the biochemical characterization of a parasite kinase and identification of its host cell targets as well as the role of host STAT6, a transcription factor, in infection._ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |

Thus, this work facilitates identification of novel exported proteins and identifies new targets for drug design._ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| {{< td-colspan 3 >}}**{{< anchor "T2" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Topic 2: Invasion of the Host Cell:** Adhesion to host cells and invasion of the intracellular space are critical steps for the traversal of host barriers leading to organ infection and pathogen spread in the organism. Invasion involves an intimate association of the pathogen with the host cell. The entire process is highly orchestrated and driven by the pathogen. We will discuss papers showing how pathogens have the ability to build its own anchorage site or take advantage of cell surface receptors to invade and disseminate to multiple organs.{{< /td-colspan >}} |||

| {{< td-colspan 3 >}}**{{< anchor "T3" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Topic 3: Determinants of Pathogen Proliferation within the Host Cell:** Intracellular pathogens are presented with a rich but challenging environment within their host cell niche. To survive, they must actively procure host nutrients for which they might be autotrophic but at the same time they must also avoid intracellular host defenses. We will examine how both eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens can subvert or be destroyed by the host autophagy pathway. We will also study how pathogens can alter host cell biology to facilitate nutrient uptake and conversely how the host can restrict nutrient access to starve the pathogen.{{< /td-colspan >}} |||

| 10 | Field Trip | {{< anchor "10" >}}{{< /anchor >}}For their field trip, students will choose a seminar from a local academic institution, focusing on infectious disease research or drug design. |
| {{< td-colspan 3 >}}**{{< anchor "T4" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Topic 4: Both Sides of the Battle: Innate Immunity versus Virulence Factors:** There is fierce selection pressure driving the co-evolution between specific host innate immune molecules and the pathogenic factors that oppose them. In many cases, genetic variation of either of these types of molecules can determine the severity of infection and ultimately disease outcomes. In the next 3 weeks, we will study specific pathogenic mechanisms for immune avoidance and how the host specifically recognizes and targets certain pathogens for destruction.{{< /td-colspan >}} |||

| {{< td-colspan 3 >}}**{{< anchor "T5" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Topic 5: Virus Meets Parasite: How Viruses and Parasites Interact, Affecting Host Fitness:** This final week will focus on two exciting examples of the interaction between a virus and the parasite _Leishmania_. In one case, a viral pathogen of the parasite itself affects the disease outcome of the host. The second case demonstrates that the virulence of HIV is affected by the presence of _Leishmania_ infecting the same host. These studies reflect a trend in infectious disease research to examine how different pathogens interact within the same host and affect host fitness in a model more representative of the real world.{{< /td-colspan >}} |||
