Written Assignment (Due on Week 8)
----------------------------------

Students will write a critical analysis of a research article of their choice. The article must be a study concerning one of the pathogens discussed in the course. The research article will have to be cleared by the instructors at least one week prior to the written assignment due date. The analysis should be no more than three pages (double-spaced, 1" margins, 12 point Times font).

Briefly summarize the background and major conclusions of the article in the first paragraph. In the subsequent paragraphs, discuss the experimental design, describe the key experiment(s) and control experiment(s), and critically evaluate the results and discussion. For example: Do the data support the conclusions? Which result is the most important? What is the key control experiment? Are any important control experiments missing? Was there a better alternative approach? Are there additional experiments that would further test the conclusions of the article? Lastly, discuss if/how the article contributes to this field of study.

Oral Presentation (Presented in the Final Class Meeting)
--------------------------------------------------------

Choose a research article to present and have it approved by the instructors. The article must be a study concerning one of the pathogens discussed in the course unless otherwise cleared by the instructors. Prepare a 15â€“20 minute presentation of the article using slides prepared with Microsoft PowerPoint or Keynote. In the introduction, briefly present the information necessary to understand the motivation and context of your chosen paper, including at least one figure derived from the primary background literature. Present the results by discussing only the key experiment(s) that concisely convey the essence of the paper, including an explanation of any specialized techniques used. Include your evaluation of the how the experiments were conducted and point out the important control(s). Discuss the conclusions as they relate to the data and the background. Do the data support the conclusions? Be critical and point out flaws in the paper. How might you expand upon these findings if you were to conduct a follow-up investigation? Be prepared to answer questions from other students and from the instructor during your presentation.
